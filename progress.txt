week1 : trying to understand what's GIT
        doing well at initialising git commiting and pushing
week2 : finally mastered "git rm" kind of easy tbh
        able to manipulate foulder in foulders
week3 : will be doing just 1 example only per lesson(for conserving time)
        nothing learned as much related to git.
        also I want to know how to revert back the progress(surely will learn later)
        1 a.m. / 31.01.2025.
